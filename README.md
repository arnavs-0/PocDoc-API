> An API based off of Infermedica's Symptom API for better usage on our Android App, PocDoc using HTTP requests

### üè† [Homepage](https://arnavs-0.github.io/PocDoc-Client/) & [GitHub Homepage](https://github.com/arnavs-0/PocDoc-Public)

## Install

Clone the repo:

```sh
https://github.com/arnavs-0/PocDoc-API.git
```

Intsall the requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

First, an Infermedica App ID and API key is required which can be obtained [here](https://developer.infermedica.com/)

In [keys.py](https://github.com/arnavs-0/PocDoc-API/blob/main/keys.py) change the following lines to your App ID and API key

```Python
APP_ID = 'Infermedica App ID here'
API_KEY = 'Infermedica API key here'
```

**This API must be hosted either hosted locally or using a Hosting Website, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is reccomended**

The API had 2 endpoints: `/symptoms` and `/diagnosis`

The `/symptoms` endpoint is a GET request that returns a JSON list of key-value symptom pairs 

```
https://YOUR_URL_HERE/symptoms
```

The `/diagnosis` endpoint is a POST request that will return a JSON List of possible diagnosis from the given information.

The following is required in the POST request:

```
gender (given at birth)
age
symptoms (Infermedica symptom ids are required)
```
Symptom IDs can be found [here](https://developer.infermedica.com/docs/v3/available-symptoms)

Sample request:

```https://YOUR_URL_HERE/diagnosis ```

Request Body:

```JSON
{
    "gender": "male",
    "age": 20,
    "symptoms": [
        "s_102",
        "s_715"
    ]
}
```
Response Body should look similar to this:

```JSON
{
    "conditions": [
        {
            "name": "Common cold",
            "probability": 33.879999999999995
        }
    ]
}
```
The name contains the medical condition, in this case ```Common Cold``` and the probability is a percentage in this case ```33.88%```
